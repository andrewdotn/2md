## The end of 32-bit apps (and other removals)

Mac hardware and macOS made the jump from 32 bits to 64 bits a long time ago,
but Catalina will be the very first version of macOS that is totally unable to
run 32-bit software. For (what I hope will be) the last time, let's review the
Mac's entire 64-bit timeline from start to finish:

  - **June 2003**: The PowerPC G5 CPU is [the first 64-bit-capable chip to show
    up in a Mac][1], and with Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, it can theoretically
    address up to 8GB of RAM.

  - **April 2005**: Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger [allows for 64-bit processes under the
    hood][2]--they can be spun off from another process or run via the
    Terminal.
