### Andrew Neitsch, 2020‑04‑04

*I’d been hoping to give this as a talk at a local developer conference today,
but since that’s been cancelled, I’ve written this article instead.*

2md is a tool I built so that I could copy-and-paste from browsers into
plain-text files, while preserving a lot of the formatting by automatically
converting the HTML to Markdown.

It works on mac, linux, and windows.

  <PauseableImage src="/doc/demo.gif" className="figure-img img-fluid rounded"/>

    Copying from the browser and getting markdown on a mac terminal.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Since I wrote it in TypeScript, it works in the browser too, so you can
even try it out right here on this page:

<ToMd/>
